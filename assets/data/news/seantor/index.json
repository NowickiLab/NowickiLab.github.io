I am actively representing the non-tenure track faculties (NTTF) on the general UT Faculty Senate meetings, interspersed with <a href=\"https://senate.utk.edu/committees/#single-collapse-11\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">the Research Council committee</a> meetings.</p>\n<p>We meet for about 3-4 hours every couple weeks, through Zoom. The recent decision was, to delay the in-person Senate / committee meetings for several reasons. The most important reason is obvious, but we recently discovered, how robust and effective discussion we can have using the Zoom chat option - all the while going through the agenda. This perhaps is the strongest argument for Zooming in the future: To have <strong>SO</strong> many more voices heard than the in-person meeting would permit.</p>\n","summary":"PI elected for the UT Faculty Senate","img":"","tags":[{"title":"service","path":"/tag/service/"},{"title":"NTTF","path":"/tag/NTTF/"},{"title":"responsibilities","path":"/tag/responsibilities/"}]}},"context":{}}
