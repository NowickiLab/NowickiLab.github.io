I am actively representing the non-tenure track faculties (NTTF) on the general UT Faculty Senate meetings, interspersed with [the Research Council committee](https://senate.utk.edu/committees/#single-collapse-11) meetings.We meet for about 3-4 hours every couple weeks, through Zoom. The recent decision was, to delay the in-person Senate / committee meetings for several reasons. The most important reason is obvious, but we recently discovered, how robust and effective discussion we can have using the Zoom chat option - all the while going through the agenda. This perhaps is the strongest argument for Zooming in the future: To have **SO** many more voices heard than the in-person meeting would permit.
