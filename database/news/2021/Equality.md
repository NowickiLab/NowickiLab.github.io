After dramatic events of 2020, this year we do that perhaps even more so than normally.I am very grateful to our [Depratmental](https://epp.tennessee.edu) Diversity and Inclusion committee and my dear friend and colleague Dr. Denita Hadziabdic-Guerry for the efforts to celebrate women, and other underrepresented groups. Indeed, we have special monthly lunches with guests/videos, and weekly updates with packets of great information. Those change every month, as each month has a different group at focus.So today, on the last day of March, I noted [the great tweet on Dr.Hadzabdic profile](https://twitter.com/TreeHealthDoc/status/1377256218008432640), which follows and underlines [another great resource](https://sammykatta.com/diversity). As all those values are dear to me as a PI and a human being, I embrace them and promote them. In the lab and out. Not only in March. ![LabPoster](./LabPoster.jpg "Good rules our lab lives by")
