## Winter Gala 2023

Every year, just before fall semester ends, the EPP Department celebrates the past months' achievements. We take an evening to dress up, gather for a formal occassion, accompanied by UT's upper administration.

We dine, we recognize recent graduate students and the recent awards by students, staff, and faculty. We play 'White Elephant' or trivia for merriment.

The 2023 edition was special. We enjoyed the rare presence of all 3 [UTIA](https://utia.tennessee.edu/leadership/) Deans and other VIPs, we dined first time (but not last!) at the lovely [Calhoun's On the River](https://calhouns.com/locations/tennessee-river/). Finally, our own [Alina Pokhrel](https://epp.tennessee.edu/navigating-graduate-research-on-callery-pear-alina-pokhrel/) was awarded a real honor.

Among other notable mentions, Alina was recognized as the 2023 receipient of the EPP Charles Wheeler Most Outstanding M.S. Student Award in Plant Pathology.
