The reason was the back-to-back meetings in our field: the [IUFRO congress](https://iufro-lisbon2022.com/) and the comparably much smaller, cameral [IUFRO workshop](https://www.gtpi2022.csic.es/) on forest pathology.Dr. Hadziabdic attended both meetings; but Sarah and yours truly only the second one, where we presented progress on molecular detection and dogwood genetics genomics in the context of powdery mildew. This presented us with great opportunity to explore Lisbon and the greater area. What a treasure trove! Both Portugal and Spain remain in our collective opinion, a tourist paradise - if only you venture off the beaten track a little bit. We enjoyed the vistas, the sunsets over the ocean, fresh seafood, bread and wine... TONS of culture to absorb, TONS of wonderful memories made, TONS of new scientific friendships and opportunities explored.We would be remiss if failed to mention the extraordinary hospitality of the IUFRO organizers with the above-and-beyond chief, [Dr. Luis Sampedro](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Luis-Sampedro). Science REALLY thrived those several days in Pontevedra. Our geeky hearts and souls were full. ![airtrip](./lisbonAIR.jpg "First attraction - right during first walk around") ![hotel](./lisbonARThotel.jpg "We stayed in a fancy artsy hotel") ![area](./lisbonARTSarea.jpg "Lisbon greater area has plenty of greens to offer") ![graffitti](./lisbonARTSgraffitti.jpg "...whereas the underground remains just as lively") ![graffitti2](./lisbonARTSgraffitti2.jpg "...to our thorough enjoyment!") ![port1](./lisbonARTSport.jpg "Terreiro do Paco goes beyond just a ferry stop") ![port2](./lisbonARTSpots.jpg "...for instance, there's a lovely goft shop with some real finds!")![port3](./lisbonARTSrlighthouse.jpg "...and many other small and large attractions.")![port4](./lisbonBplaza.jpg "Praca do Comercio")![port5](./lisbonBumbrella.jpg "...was our entry gate to the oldest part of the city - Alfama.")![port6](./lisbonBview.jpg "TONS of fantastic views from every which direction.")![port7](./lisbonCBelem.jpg "Belem, in Lisbon area, greeted us with the magnificent monument park")![port8](./lisbonCTorre.jpg "....before allowing us into the REAL deal - Torre de Belem")![sintra1](./lisbonDsintra.jpg "After work part was completed - it was time to play.
