## 4th paper out in 2021

In the summer heat, things keep to simmer in the lab and in the press.

Our another BIG paper uses the molecular markers (microsatellites; SSRs) to deliver an ultimate piece of evidence in downy mildew pathogens separation. Using population genetics tools, we uncover the evolutionary scenarios of the speciation between *Pseudoperonospora cubensis* and *P. humuli* (Oomycetes causing downy mildews of, respectively, cucurbits and hop).


In our [just-published paper](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fmicb.2021.686759/full), on top of all other findings, we capture the ongoing speciation within *P. cubensis* itself, hinted at several times before. We also apply comparative genomics to some astounding (and very sobering!) conclusions.

Work on this paper was challenging, owing to its multi-layer character, dearth of data and analyses, and number of co-authors whose pertinent comments and advice needed to be implemented. Overall, I'm very pleased with the outcome, and so seems the whole team of Authors. More to follow, for sure!
