Trigiano](https://epp.tennessee.edu/people/directory/dr-robert-trigiano/)â€™s laboratory. I came to [UTIA](https://ag.tennessee.edu/Pages/default.aspx) from the [Research Institute of Horticulture (Skierniewice, Poland)](http://www.inhort.pl) where I spent six years (2010-2016) studying molecular background of (a)biotic stress responses in economically important plants. I held one post-doctoral position before that (joint Max-Planck Institute for [Molecular Plant Physiology [Golm, Germany]](https://www.mpimp-golm.mpg.de/2168/en) and [Michigan State University](https://prl.natsci.msu.edu) in 2006-2009). My primary teaching responsibilities in the past were Cell Biology and Biochemistry and lab mentoring of the students.I received my Ph.D. at the Technical University Aachen (RWTH Aachen, Germany) under the supervision of [Prof. Dr. Margrit Frentzen](http://www.bio1.rwth-aachen.de/SpecialBotany/team.html) in the Institute for Botany / Unit of Special Botany. My research program at [EPP](https://epp.tennessee.edu) has largely focused on functional, population, and evolutionary studies of plants and their pathogens.Mentoring is a critical link between my research, teaching, and outreach activities. I have mentored several colleagues both in the formal setting and in the lab (under/graduate students and postdocs). Drawing from my personal history, I am committed to empowering the underrepresented groups in STEM.![Yours-truly](./3M4A9809.jpg)
