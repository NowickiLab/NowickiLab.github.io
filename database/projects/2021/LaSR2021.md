Project synopsis
----------

Asian callery pear (*Pyrus&nbsp;calleryana*) swarms the continental US, but also invades Europe and Australia. Successful management strategies are needed, including rapid detection of newly infested sites.

Callery pear (CP) is an aggressive, thorny, invasive species in the eastern U.S. that causes economic and environmentaldamage. Its fast growth leads to rapid invasion of natural and managed areas. Originally confined to old fields and disturbedareas, recent observations indicate that CP is also a threat to natural and managed forested landscapes.

Digital aerial imagery has been used to track insect and disease issues as well as disturbance events but has not been widely used to track thespread of invasive trees like CP. CP presents an optimal system with which to test this approach due to its high visibility fromearly flowering and ongoing projects and images which have documented many current infestations. 

Using CP as a model system, we will mine archived digital imagery to detect and quantify spread dynamics into managed forests. Our approach using digitalaerial imagery to predict and track invasive plant spread may be transferable beyond CP and multiple aspects will be applicablebeyond the life of this project. 

## **Project goals**
This two-year project will leverage publicly available information with archived digital aerial imagery to develop invasive speciesspread models that will help identify landscapes and forests at risk of Callery pear infestation.

To complete this goal, we will address three connected objectives:
  * use archived digital aerial imagery and phenological data to characterize spread-in-time of wild Callery pear progeny and to identify active infestation sites for next-step field validation;
  * use these identifiedexamples to develop spread and risk models that will be
  * field-validated with site surveys at key active infestation sites.
